Participated in the 14th Annual Student Unmanned Aerial Systems Competition at Webster Field, St Inigoes, Maryland, USA from June 15 to 18, 2016. Placed 5th Overall.

Early Stages
======
My initial task in the team was to develop image processing programs that had to detect and extract targets of interest from aerial images. The aerial images were captured by an onboard Nikon DSLR camera that was remotely operated using an Odroid C1 and the gphoto2 bash terminal tool.

Some examples of the images obtained in-flight are:

The above image is a typical image obtained, one with no targets in it.

<img src='/images/Target.JPG'>
The above image is an example of an image that can be called "difficult", one with many non-targets that can easily be detected as targets. The real target that is to be filtered out of this image is the Blue semi-circle in the top-right of the image, with a Pink 'I' on it.
