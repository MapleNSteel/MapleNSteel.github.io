I am a first year graduate student currently pursuing my Master of Science Degree in Robotics Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India.
<br />
<br />
My interests are primarily in Control, Systems Engineering, Computer Vision, and Motion Planning of Robotic Systems. I have prior experience with designing the navigation system and the computer vision system for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, designed for the Students' Unmanned Aerial Systems competition 2016 and led the Software sub-team of [Team Edhitha](http://www.edhitha-uas.com/). 
<br />
I also have undergraduate level research experience and have published a paper on aerial path-planning and obstacle avoidance.
<br />
<br />
Currently working on making a Traxxas Rally 4-wheel drive 1/10 RC car autonomous, designing a low-level controller for the rally car.
<br />
<br />
Between July and December of 2017, I [developed](https://github.com/MapleNSteel/TVM) interoperability modules and arm-control modules for bi-manual coordination of Baxter robot's arms. Baxter robot's arms were controlled using the Vicon-motion capture system for acquiring human joint angle data. Video: [https://youtu.be/Fy6iVArQv2A](https://youtu.be/Fy6iVArQv2A)

<br />
My [undergraduate project](https://github.com/MapleNSteel/DR-detect-and-classify) was the implementation of a CNN for detecting and classifying Diabetic Retinopathy using Fundus Images. Libraries used were OpenCV, Theano, and Lasagne.
<br />	
<br />
In the third year of my undergraduate career, I designed a fully autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and participated in the Students' Unmanned Aerial Systems 2016 competition held by the AUVSI foundation, as a member of [Team Edhitha](http://www.edhitha-uas.com/) a group of undergraduate engineers from my Alma Mater. I led the software sub-team and designed a complete system for autonomous aerial survey, using images acquired from the aircraft whilst in flight.
