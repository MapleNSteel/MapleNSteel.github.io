I am a first year graduate student currently pursuing my Master of Science Degree in Robotics Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India.
<br />
My interests are primarily in Control, Systems Engineering, Computer Vision, and Motion Planning of Robotic Systems. I have prior experience with designing the navigation system and the computer vision system for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, designed for the Students' Unmanned Aerial Systems competition 2016 and led the Software sub-team of [Team Edhitha](http://www.edhitha-uas.com/). 
<br />
I also have undergraduate level research experience and have published a paper on aerial path-planning and obstacle avoidance.
